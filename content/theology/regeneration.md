## Introduction

{% summary() %}
What is Regeneration?
{% end %}

Regeneration is a spiritual change brought about by the Holy Spirit in the heart of someone. God is the sole actor in the act of regeneration; we are dead recipients of this act. It is a new birth, a new life. The heart that was once cold to the things of God is woken up. What was once foolish is desirable. 

In the Old Testament, regeneration was announced as part of the coming New Covenant. Regeneration is one of the differences between the Old and New Covenant.

## Regeneration Precedes Faith

Regeneration must happen to a person before they would believe. Prior to regeneration the depraved person is dead to the things of God, unwilling, untrusting, blind, and dead. In this condition there is no hope for fallen man on his own. God must intervene and give life where there is none.

## Regeneration Through the Gospel

{% summary() %}
The gospel is God's ordained means to bring about the new birth
{% end %}

Regeneration doesn't happen randomly, or arbitrarily. The gospel is the power of God for salvation, because the Gospel is god's ordained means for bringing about regeneration. It is while someone hears or contemplates the realities of the gospel that the Holy Spirit gives the life, replaces the heart of stone, grants sight to the blind eyes, etc.
